This is a very important window into the mind of the next generation of highly skilled engineers.
This fork represents how one person Reverse engineered the Parler API and conducted data exfiltration operation in excess of 50 Terabytes.
What can we learn from this event to make future api implementations more robust?
This event was conducted by a 26 years old, coordinated a large group on twitter, and used off the shelf software. 
Read and learn. -R

Parler's unofficial API with all endpoints present in their iOS app as of 08/12/2020.

For the most part undocumented, but the error responses are already quite descriptive.

Any endpoint starting with `/v3/` is protobuf-based. The .proto files can be found elsewhere.

Use it to solve fun mysteries such as:

- Is my dad on Parler?
- Who was on Parler before it first started gaining popularity when Candice Owens tweeted about in December 2018?
- Which users have administration and moderation rights? (hint: `(interactions >> 5) & 1` = moderator, `(interactions >> 6) & 1` = admin)
- What exactly is an "integration partner", and which media entities currently are they?
- If Parler is really yet to come up with a business model for how to make money, then what exactly is a Campaign Promoter Management Network?
- How does the payment integration that lets users be financially rewarded for their posts play into that?
- Whenever John Matze says "influencer marketing" should I really be hearing, "we've created a pavlovian conditioning machine that rewards already gullible people for organically spreading disinformation campaigns"? (most likely)
- Is Parler really the world's most secure social network? (no)

I rushed this just so I didn't have to stare at ghidra anymore. There might be bugs/typos. Patches welcome.

### Usage ###

```python
from parler import Parler

parler = Parler('mst_cookie', 'jst_cookie') # You can also just do the login flow.
parler.user_api.get_profile_for_user(params={'id': 'a078092e6e2df507bfd12db4710202ab'})
```
